# Agent onboarding — Sputnik Crowd Tracker

Paste this as the opening context when starting a new AI agent to build a feature or improvement in this repo.

---

You are working on **Sputnik Crowd Tracker**, a personal side project that tracks how busy the Sputnik Climbing gym venues are over time and visualizes it in a dashboard.

## What the project does

A scraper polls the gym's public occupancy API every 60 seconds and stores one row per venue per reading in a database. A Next.js dashboard reads that accumulated history and renders charts (heatmap, hourly averages, live status) so a user can tell the best and worst times to visit each venue. (The 30-day time-series and per-day-of-week charts are temporarily parked to reduce Turso reads — their tested queries remain in `queries.ts` for a future revisit.)

## Architecture (3 parts, pnpm monorepo)

1. **`scraper/`** — a `tsx` CLI. `src/index.ts` fetches the gym page for a CSRF token + cookie, POSTs to the occupancy endpoint, maps the **Spanish API fields to English** in `src/transform.ts`, and batch-inserts into the DB. It collects only while venues are open: per-venue opening hours live in `src/open-hours.ts` (config, since the API exposes no hours), and the scraper skips the whole cycle when all venues are closed and inserts only the venues currently open otherwise — trimming overnight reads/writes. The freshness monitor shares the same hours logic so it doesn't false-alarm overnight. Runs on a Raspberry Pi via cron/systemd every 60s (not in the cloud — the gym server blocks datacenter IPs). `seed-dev.ts` generates ~90 days of realistic mock data for local dev.
2. **Database** — Turso (LibSQL/SQLite). Single table `readings(id, timestamp, venue_id, venue_name, occupancy, entries, exits, capacity)`. Derived metrics (e.g. occupancy %) are computed in SQL, not stored.
3. **`dashboard/`** — Next.js 16 App Router, React 19. Server components in `src/components/sections/` fetch data via `src/lib/cached-queries.ts` (which wrap `src/lib/queries.ts` in `unstable_cache`). There is **no data API route** — server components query Turso directly. Minimal client components handle interactivity (venue selector, theme toggle, unit toggle, 60s auto-refresh). Each venue has its own path — `/<venue-slug>` (e.g. `/las-rozas`), served by the optional catch-all route `app/[[...venue]]/page.tsx`. The bare domain `/` renders an all-venues live overview — the venue cards plus placeholder chart cards (`ChartPlaceholder`) that prompt the user to pick a venue; selecting one navigates to its slug path, which fills in the heatmap + hourly charts. Legacy `/?venue=<id>` links 308-redirect to their slug path. Slugs are derived from venue names by `src/lib/venues.ts`. SEO/metadata lives in the App Router metadata layer: per-venue titles via `generateMetadata` in `app/[[...venue]]/page.tsx`, site-wide tags in `app/layout.tsx`, plus `app/robots.ts`, `app/sitemap.ts`, and a generated `app/opengraph-image.tsx`; all resolve the public base URL through `src/lib/site.ts` (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`).

## Conventions you MUST follow

- **English everywhere in code** — identifiers, variables, comments, table/column names are all English, even though the domain (gym, venues) is Spanish. The only Spanish that belongs in code: (a) mapping the Spanish API field names on ingest in `transform.ts`, and (b) user-facing UI labels (day/hour names live in `lib/labels.ts`).
- **TypeScript strict mode, no `any`.** The scraper also uses `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`.
- **Timestamps are UTC in the DB.** Always convert to `Europe/Madrid` at query time using the existing DST-aware helper (`madridOffsetModifier()` in `queries.ts`). Do not store local time.
- **Keep Turso reads low** — that's why queries are cached with staggered revalidation (live: 60s, aggregates: 300s, venues: 3600s). New data-fetching should go through `cached-queries.ts`, not raw `queries.ts`, in components.
- **This is NOT the Next.js in your training data.** Next.js 16 has breaking API changes. Before writing dashboard code, read the relevant guide under `dashboard/node_modules/next/dist/docs/` and heed deprecation notices (this is the standing instruction in `dashboard/AGENTS.md`).
- **Prefer server components**; reach for client components only when interactivity genuinely requires it.

## Local development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm seed-dev                 # generate ~90 days mock data into ./dev.db
cd dashboard && pnpm dev:mock # run dashboard against the local SQLite file
pnpm test                     # Vitest across both packages
```

`dev:mock` sets `TURSO_URL=file:../dev.db`, so you don't need real Turso credentials to develop the dashboard. Use `MOCK_NOW=<ISO timestamp>` to freeze "now" for reproducible views/tests.

## Files worth reading first

- `scraper/src/index.ts` and `transform.ts` — ingestion + the Spanish→English mapping.
- `scraper/src/open-hours.ts` — per-venue opening-hours config + the "is it open now?" helpers that gate collection (and the freshness monitor).
- `dashboard/src/lib/queries.ts` — all SQL, the timezone handling, the metric definitions.
- `dashboard/src/lib/cached-queries.ts` — caching layer.
- `dashboard/src/app/[[...venue]]/page.tsx` — how sections, the `/<venue-slug>` route param, and the `?unit=` search param compose the dashboard.
- `PLAN.md` — original design intent. **Caveat:** parts are aspirational (the GitHub Actions cron and an `api/readings/` route were never built). Trust the code over the plan.

## Working agreement

- **Git:** work on a branch per task (`type/kebab-desc`), make logical commits, then push and open a PR at the end — never commit to `main` or merge the PR yourself. See `CLAUDE.md` → "Git workflow" for the full flow.
- **The task isn't done until CI is green.** After opening the PR, watch its checks (`gh pr checks <n> --watch`); if a check fails, read the logs (`gh run view <run-id> --log-failed`), fix it, and push until everything passes. CI builds against an empty DB and a clean install, so a green local run doesn't guarantee a green CI run.
- **The task isn't done until GitHub Copilot's review is addressed.** Copilot auto-reviews a PR once when it's opened. Read its comments (`gh pr view <n> --comments`; inline threads via `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<n>/comments`) and either fix each actionable point and push, or reply explaining why it doesn't apply. Either way, **reply on each thread once you've addressed it — even the ones you fixed in code — citing the fix/commit, so no thread is left silent** (`gh api --method POST repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<n>/comments/<comment-id>/replies -f body='…'`). It does **not** re-review on push — after fixing, re-request it explicitly using the bot's **login** (not its display name): `gh api --method POST repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<n>/requested_reviewers -f 'reviewers[]=copilot-pull-request-reviewer[bot]'`. ⚠️ Passing `reviewers[]=Copilot` returns HTTP 200 but **silently does nothing**, so verify it took — append `--jq 'any(.requested_reviewers[]; .login == "Copilot")'` to the request and confirm it prints `true` (a membership check, so it still passes when other reviewers are also requested) — and never pipe this call to `/dev/null`. The login/display split is expected, not a bug: you *request* the bot by its login `copilot-pull-request-reviewer[bot]`, but GitHub normalizes it in the `requested_reviewers` response to the display login `Copilot`, so `.login` reads back `Copilot` rather than the login you sent. It only re-posts when it finds something new, so no new review within a few minutes means nothing further to flag. Repeat until clean.
- **Test any new functionality, not just the data layer; aim to keep the whole project covered.** Queries and pure helpers get unit tests; React components get [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) tests running on happy-dom (config in `dashboard/vitest.config.ts`, matchers + RTL cleanup in `dashboard/vitest.setup.ts` — note the scraper has its own `vitest.config.ts`). Prefer extracting non-trivial logic out of components into testable modules (e.g. `lib/venue-routing.ts`) rather than leaving it inline and untested. Brittle/low-value surfaces (Recharts internals, async server components that only fetch) may be skipped — note it in the PR. When you add a query specifically, add it to `queries.ts`, test it, and expose it through `cached-queries.ts` with an appropriate revalidation window.
- Match the surrounding code's style and altitude.
- Mention any new env vars and update `README.md` if you change setup, scripts, or env.
